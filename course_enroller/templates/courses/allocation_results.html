<h1>Registrations</h1>
<p>
    Below is a table of all student registrations. 
    Each student is listed with their registered courses. 
    If a student has fewer than five registered courses, the remaining cells will be empty. <br>
    This is an indication that the student was not lucky enough to be allocated all five of their preferred courses.
