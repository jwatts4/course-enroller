<h1>Course List</h1>
<p>
    Below is a table of all courses. Each course is listed with its course code, 
    course name, occupied seats, total seats, and status. The status of a course 
    is either "Full" or "Open". <br> A course is considered full if the number of occupied 
    seats is greater than or equal to the total number of seats.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is that the user can see which courses are full and which are open, and 
    then decide which courses they would like to enroll in.
